Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own “card”.

Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.

Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library. 

Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
